# MERN stack boilerplate

A boilerplate for building web app with the MERN stack.

## Installation

Use the npm package manager to install node modules.

```bash
npm install # installs backend node modules
cd client # switch to frontend client directory
npm install # installs frontend node modules
cd .. # switch to project root directory
```

## Add configurations

Add two `.json` configuration files in the `config` directory, and save them `default.json` as and `production.json`

The configuration files should contain the following:

```bash
foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
